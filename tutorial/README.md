# Noah-MP model tutorial material

The tutorial materials are prepared mainly by Dr. Zhe Zhang (NCAR). If users have any questions, please contact Cenlin he (cenlinhe@ucar.edu) and Zhe Zhang (zhezhang@ucar.edu).

This folder archives the tutorial material for running the offline Noah-MP models. 
Note that Noah-MP code (https://github.com/NCAR/noahmp) needs to be run in a host model frame such as HRLDAS, UFS, WRF, MPAS, LIS, etc.
