# Root-Noah-MP 

This branch includes HRLDAS/Noah-MP version 4.5 with a dynamic root scheme that simulates deep root water uptake. See [Fan et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712381114) for details on the root scheme. This version of the model also includes additional resolved soil layers and soil properties which vary with depth according to an exponential decay model [Miguez-Macho and Fan 2012](https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JD017539).
