! A Multi-pass Land Data Assimilation Scheme (MLDAS) based on Noah-MP-Crop model
! The leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations are simultaneously assimilated into the Noah-MP-Crop model based on the MLDAS to predict sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes as well as gross primary productivity (GPP).
! The code demonstrates implementation of the MLDAS as proposed in paper "Xu, T., Chen, F., He, X., Barlage, M., Zhang, Z., Liu, S., & He, X. (2021). Improve the performance of the Noah-MP-Crop model by jointly assimilating soil moisture and vegetation phenology data. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 13, e2020MS002394. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002394".

## Quick Start

Before that, you need to run the Noah-MP-Crop model normally.
These files from the example need to be copied to the run directory.
You need to prepare the restart file and observation data in advance, and modify the namelist.hrldas file appropriately.
The code was tested with Python 3.7. To use this code, please do:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```shell
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NCAR/hrldas.git
   cd hrldas/run/
   cp ./examples/single_MLDAS/* ./
   mkdir restart
   mkdir output
   mkdir output_final
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   module load python/3.7.5
   pip install --user numpy
   pip install --user pandas
   pip install --user netCDF4
   ```
3. Create single point forcing in the "../HRLDAS_forcing/run/examples/single_point_MLDAS/".

   ```shell
   make
   ./create_forcing.exe
   ```

4. Start `Python` and run the `MP-Crop-MLDAS-draft-v1.0.py` locally.

   ```shell
   python ./MP-Crop-MLDAS-draft-v1.0.py
   ```
